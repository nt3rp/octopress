Quite the title *eh*? If you're confused, and you probably are, let's take a step back.

What exactly is a hacker? If you believe everything you see in movies and TV, a hacker is a person who sits in front of a half dozen computer monitors typing away furiously while 3D manifestations dance across the screen as the hacker breaks some security system (*thank you [Swordfish][Swordfish]*). Alternatively, you may think of some obese person staring in front of a dark computer with lime green text ([something like this](http://hackertyper.net/134076482139); go on, try typing on that page).

If you thought that you'd be wrong. *Partly*, at least.

*Hacker* is a pretty loaded term. From what I know, at the least, it can refer to...

* People who break security systems by unauthorized means
* People who "hack" away at technology to modify it or push it's limits. These types of hackers tend to be associated with [Arduino][Arduino] boards.
* Software developers, primarily those in the free software movement, but anyone who really delights in the specifics of some computer system
* Programmers, engineers, or scientists who work to make things better.

...and I mean, that's a pretty terse definition. I mean, [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/gba.html) has a way better article on it than I do.

Anyway, getting back to the point. I am a hacker, and I'm proud of it, and why shouldn't I be? Over the course of a weekend, I flashed new firmware on my router to make it easier to use and more configurable, I put a new operating system on my netbook to make it last even longer, and tonight I'm going to flash a new ROM on my phone to give it new functionality. I can develop just about whatever I want if I put my mind to it, and I can share it with the world on [github](http://github.com) or something similar. If I have a problem with my computer or some piece of technology, I can figure it out, and help other folks figure it out. If I want to do something crazy like make a proton pack for a Halloween costume, I can get out the soldering iron, read some schematics, and figure out how to wire the lighting.

...And the stuff that I do pales in comparison to some of the amazing stuff other folks do. Really.

Why am I a hacker? A better question is **why aren't you?**
