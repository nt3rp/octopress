Oftentimes, it can be difficult to get focussed; difficult to get centered. When one area of your life is well-maintained, like your career, other areas can wane, like your health. It's difficult to just get everything sorted out.

In a much narrower field of view, it can often be difficult to make hard decisions around a project, or around your expectations. What do you want to be, for example? Do you know? What do you aspire to do?

I've made an effort to give this blog focus, and suffice to say, I've meandered a lot, and I will likely meander quite a bit in the future as well, but I'm working towards focussing, and narrowing down what it is that I want to say.

After having a chat with [a few](http://goboxbox.blogspot.ca/) [good friends](http://malachiconstantjr.wordpress.com/) over the weekend, we talked a lot about the different possibilities that exist such as focussing on career advice. I don't entirely think that I'm qualified to talk about career advice, but if people are interested in more of that, or asking questions, I'd be glad to contribute. Even though I am apprehensive about it, a quick look at [my archives](blog/archives) shows a clear predeliction for topics related to:
- Startups
- Job search
- General motivation

So, perhaps such a focus is not as unreasonable as I think it is.

What do you think? Do you, O generous reader, have burning questions on your mind in need of answering? Do you enjoy my rambles about startups and careers? Do you want to see (more / any) code / programming?

Regardless of the (presumed lack of) input, I am genuinely interested what you *<Reader>* want to hear more of; I don't particularly enjoy speaking to an echo chamber, of course, and I hope to keep meta-blogging (such as this) to a minimum.
