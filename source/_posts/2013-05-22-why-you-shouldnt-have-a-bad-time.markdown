I have been putting this off for a while; almost two weeks at this point.

At first, I was going to entitle this *Why you shouldn't fire your first employee, launch your first major customer, and have your hotel reservations accidentally cancelled in the same week*, but that was getting a bit long in the tooth, and I kept finding outer things to complain about. I think that paints a bit of a picture as to why things have been *delayed*.

But let's take this and make it a positive experience. Let's take a look at what good fortune has come out of these circumstances. I'm going to touch briefly on what happened

## On firing your first employee
I'll admit, this was not easy. At [my company](http://www.willetinc.com), we aren't exactly bursting out the seams with staff, so every person matters, and losing a team member is rough, as its both difficult to hire a suitable replacement, difficult to explain to the person that things are not working out, and difficult to deal with the lack of that extra set of hands in the interim.

What good came out of this? If you've ever been in a situation where it feels like the entire team is being brought down by one member, then you should know how good it feels when either the project is completed, or that person is removed from the team. In as much as that's a marginal good, the loss of one teammate also means a gain in terms of my experience: I now know what its like to see an employee from hire to fire, and the ups and downs involved in that process, which really conjures up the common idiom of *hire slowly and fire quickly*

## ... and Launching your first major customer
The above in combination with launching your first customer can be... troubling. We managed to deliver the project on time, but there have been quite a few weekends and late nights in order to get it all done, and we had to work down to the wire to do so. I'm still working my way back to a normal level of stress after all the hard work and hacking that needed to be done to get things in order.

On the upside, we managed to get [an opportunity with a particularly large brand](http://gap.secondfunnel.com/summerdresses), and we saw what good we are capable of doing (at the cost of having a big mess to clean up, but hey, progress).

## ... and having your hotel reservations cancelled
This one is a bit random in comparisson. Every year (almost) for the past many years, I've been attending [Anime North](http://animenorth.com) in Toronto, and, generally, I reserve the hotel rooms. Because the rooms tend to book up quickly, [I wrote this script](https://github.com/nt3rp/Hotel-Tracker) which [posts to twitter](https://twitter.com/AN_HotelTracker) if there is at least one room available at the hotel. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done and its better than nothing. This year, despite booking in November, I got bumped because the hotel overbooked. I won't get into too many details (this time) but needless to say, the reservations were cancelled and now at some inconvenience and with little notice I have had to obtain lodging elsewhere.

What have I learned from this mess? *Build a better mousetrap* so to speak: either make the script better, and possibly book rooms automatically, or just book earlier (which I would rather not, as I feel it is rude to the event organizers).

...

There were a lot of other unfortunate things that took place, but what's important is to *keep on keeping on* and **not have a bad time**.

Because honestly? It'll all be better, in the grand scheme of things.
