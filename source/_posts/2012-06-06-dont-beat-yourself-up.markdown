When working on things, there are often setbacks, distractions, detours, roadblocks, *whatever*. These things are understandably a nuisance, but for the most part are unavoidable. **Sometimes, you fall off the horse**, so to speak.

I know it goes without saying that when you fall off the horse, **you get back up**, but I think there's a bit more to it that's understated. There's a bit more to dealing with these setbacks.

I think the bit that's understated is that, regardless of what problem there is, **don't beat yourself up over it**. If you've made a mistake, learn from it and *move on*. If something bad has happened, find the good in it and *get over it*. Especially if the problem is really beyond your control.

As an example, I thought I had a pretty good pace with the blog, and I missed updating yesterday. *Oh well*; Just got to keep on moving.

Short post today, but *I'm not going to beat myself up over it*.

Hopefully in the coming days, I can move off the of this 'self-help' series and into some more substantial content.
