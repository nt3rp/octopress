I may have mentioned before that I've had the opportunity to interview folks before. *This is true*. After a phone call today, I realized exactly *how long* it had been since such an ocassion. To put it lightly, assuming that I was *ever in practice before*, I am most certainly out of practice now with regard to interviewing.

So today, as I was wrapping up other tasks at work, and, effectively, starting with a clean slate, I began looking into what it takes to interview folks. Specifically, I'm prepping for an interview with potential software development and user experience interns, which is a bit different from interviewing, say, a full-time person.

To clarify off, I haven't interviewed *anyone* in the past three years, and I've certainly never interviewed anyone while at a startup. It got me thinking **how things are on the other side of the table**, so to speak.

There are plenty of [good](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/how-to-hire-a-programmer.html) [resources](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html) [out](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions) [there](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/03/on-interviewing-programmers.html) for interviewing technical people, more specifically, software developers; if you're interested, you should check out those.

A lot of the advice that's given usually emphasizes a few key points:
- Hiring is important; don't half-ass it. Bad hires are more expensive than good ones. If you have any reservations about a candidate, do your best to resolve them, and if you can't, don't hire them.
- You're really looking for two qualities: smart, and gets things done. It's difficult to gauge these two qualities, but having one or the other isn't sufficient
- Passion is a really good indicator of the quality of a candidate. Passion is hard to measure, but projects are a good indicator.

It's going to be interesting to be on the other side of the table again. I'll follow-up after Wednesday with my insights after I've actually had the opportunity to hire again.
