[I might have mentioned](/blog/2013/05/22/why-you-shouldnt-have-a-bad-time/) going to Anime North a few weeks ago. I might have also mentioned, as part of that, the hotel troubles that I had gone through before hand.

Organizing everything for attending a convention can be stressful enough as is: Getting enough people for a group, booking the right number of hotels rooms, figuring out transportation, distributing the passes, collecting all the cash; it can be a serious pain, but it is one that I typically take in stride.

The biggest pain this year was, as mentioned, having our hotel rooms cancelled unexpectedly, without warning. To elaborate more on the circumstances, I had only received any notice whatsoever because I had booked extra rooms, and was giving the extra rooms away as a favour. When one of the rooms was being transferred, the other party had been told that the reservation had been cancelled, and thus the other party alerted me. This lead to a series of phone calls wherein I filed several complaints with the hotel, sought any sort of recompensation, and deperately sought out alternative means to obtain a room. Had I not done that person a 'favour' I would not have been alerted at all, despite booking more than seven months in advance. The hotel was overbooked and they *"couldn't do anything about it"*.

You might expect *this is the point where I start a crusade*. Fire the social media cannons! Call up anonymous! **Get outraged!**

I'll admit, I'm still sore about the situation, but I don't think that being outraged is really going to accomplish much, nor that I would get very far with. I'm also not convinced such action is necessary as it appears that the hotel will be losing the 'Doubletree' moniker, which I suspect means that the hotel has suffered enough complaints to become disenfranchised. I can only speculate, of course.

No, I would rather talk about what I did to improve the situation, and improving the situation is necessary **as the hotel is already fully booked for next year.** *Really.*

...

More than a year ago, as github would tell me, **I started on a project called [HotelTracker](https://github.com/nt3rp/HotelTracker)**: a crude python script that effectively scraped Anime North hotels for availability. The goal of the project was, and continues to be, developing a tool that can help other people find out about hotel availability. It's come a long way since its inception, but there are still many changes and improvements to be made.

I realize that I don't often talk about technical subjects on this blog, and when I do I tend to focus on things at a higher level, and I hope that I can continue to talk about subjects at a high level... but I think that there's a lot of opportunity to explain the process of going from an idea, to a concrete implementation, especially with HotelTracker, as its a relatively simple software project. I want to talk about how it started, how it has come along, and where it is going. *As a software developer looking to become a better developer and a better writer*, **I'm hoping to post about HotelTracker more often in special blog posts like this one**.

While I may not have succeeded at getting a hotel room yet, I'm hoping that HotelTracker will find me a room, and, in the long run, other people as well. **I'll have to tell you all about how it got started**... *another time though*.
