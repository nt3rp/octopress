A recurring theme on this blog is that of careers and the job search... not because I'm constantly looking or anything, but mostly because of my own track record, and how I seem to have accumulated some experience on the matter. Ocassionally, [I take people down a notch](/blog/2013/03/24/you-are-not-special/) (unintentionally) or [issue imperatives](/blog/2013/04/13/do-something-everyday/), or even [vent](/blog/2012/07/03/uprooted-and-in-california/) or just [observe](/blog/2012/07/22/living-in-america-driving/). Most of the time, these posts just end up read by friends and family, which I appreciate, with the ocassional post [reaching a lot further](/blog/2012/06/12/a-day-in-the-life-voice-actor/).

... that is a *lot* of self-references...

In any case, I don't have a magic formula for success. I haven't perfected or even begun to master the way to reach out to broader audiences; those are things I have yet to experiment with. But, I do know how to get noticed (to some extent), *and* I'll share those methods with you today.

They are by no means secret, or the fastest means, but they will work in the long run.

No memes this time folks (sorry).

**Do Good Work**  
No tricks here, just do good work. Whatever that work is: be it a blog, or a comic, or a novel. Work at it, make it the best you can, make a lot of mistakes; just keep working on whatever it is until you have good work. Keep at it!

**Speak up**  
Let people know about what you've done! You don't need to brag, but share what you've created. Expose your work to the world, and bear the criticisms; take the praise, and whatever else comes.

*Why do I bring this up?* Earlier this week, I was approached about writing a book. A *technical* book mind you, but a book nonetheless.

**So what?**

I'm certainly [capable of writing a book](/blog/2012/12/02/how-to-write-in-fifty-thousand-words-or-more/), but the fact of the matter is that someone reached out to *me*; someone approached *me* about writing a book as a result of my [stackoverflow account](http://stackoverflow.com/users/165988/nt3rp).

*Someone noticed me.* Of no particular action or promotion of my own.

And that's what I mean. *I do good work* on Stackoverflow and elsewhere, and even though I don't say much about it, that work is there: it exists; it is out for the world to see. I have *spoken up*, to some extent.

And **that's all it takes anyone to be noticed**. Just those two simple things. They are by no means the fastest or only ways, but they do work.
